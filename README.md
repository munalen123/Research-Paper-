Abstract - This research paper explains the comparative differences between the GWO algorithm and the Yen-K shortest path algorithm, notably comparing the methodologies of each algorithm. This study analyzes the algorithms computational complexity, memory consumption, time difference, and efficiency as GPS traffic routers. Our results concluded that GWO outperformed Yen–K shortest path in efficiency and in finding the optimal path, however its large memory consumption leads it to being unsuitable for lightweight applications.
